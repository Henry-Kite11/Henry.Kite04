    <td>Today are lesson was a bit different but still had something to do with coding. The other year 8 class came into ours and we had a lesson together. Our teacher asked us to  explain the steps of making a cup of tea. People said things like pour the water, the get a teabag,and milk and mix it all together. Sir then said imagine you were programming a robot how to make a cup of tea. </td>

    <td>I learnt that to programme a robot or even any coding, you have to be simple and precise. You have to imagine that the robot or coding knows absolutely nothing and you have to give commands step by step.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>

    <td>After learning this, next week when we go back to code academy I will try and be simple and precise to make it easier for the computer to understand.</td>
