    <td>Strategies that we effective was concentrating really hard and cancelling people out and just getting on with it even though I find codecademy quite hard. As I was going to have exams after that week I realised it was my last week of codecademy before half term so I wanted to do a lot of work on the last day.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I need to work on not getting so annoyed and frustrated when I can't do something. I get really annoyed which probably makes me lose concentration which means I can't work to the best of my ability of be able to finish that bit of coding.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will try and have some more perseverance and if i do get stuck or can't do a certain bit of coding i will try to not get annoyed and just keep going at it as theirs no point giving. You cant learn without making mistakes so you've got to just keep trying </td>
