    <td>What I learnt is that you learn more from the longer and more difficult parts of code academy. Even though this sounds obvious, it's true as if the coding tests your brain more and you have to think harder, its more helpful to your learning than the easier ones. I have just finished functions which is number 5 on code academy python. Ive been on it for 2-3 weeks but ive found it the most helpful and I understand a lot more thanks to it being harder and longer.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What I need to work on is that if I complete something or do it well, I should use it for the next coding. In code academy you do loads or little coding (normally 1-12) that then all add together for the last bit of coding. As they are all connected they will have something in common so if you  complete no.1 that knowledge should help you with no.2</td>

    <td>What I will change is that if I do something well or find it easy, I should use that to my advantage and it will probably help in later coding and obstacles I will need to tackle.</td>
