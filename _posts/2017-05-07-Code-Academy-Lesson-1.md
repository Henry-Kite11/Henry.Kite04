    <td>The way I learnt was by trying things out on my learning own. No one had used this program before so no one could really help each other until we got started. So instead I used the program for help. It told you what you were trying to make (for example a variable) and what the coding was to make it. This really helped as it told you what to do but also explained it to you. Also if you got stuck their was a hint button that helped you if you were stuck.</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning was I had never used the program before. This meant it took a little while to get used to it. However everyone had the same problem. One of the habits I need to work on is being more independent. When I was stuck I always asked for a lot of help and never tried to work it out myself.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>To improve my learning I will try and stop the habit of always asking for help. Sometimes it is good to get help as you learn from your mistakes and other people might know or see something differently to you, however I should always try and persevere first and try and work it out myself before asking Friends or teachers for help. This is our first week and I think the more I get used to this program I will not need as much help from others and will be able to finish the program in the time period we have.</td>
