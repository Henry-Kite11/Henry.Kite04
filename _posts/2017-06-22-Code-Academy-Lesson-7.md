    <td>Today our teacher looked at our blogs one by one and gave us feedback on them, pointing out those were good and who needed to work on their blog and make a lot of changes. Strategies that were effective were getting feedback and some criticism. I got told what was good, and bad about my blog. With codecademy i got on well and got a lot of work done and ive nearly finished the functions topic. </td>

    <td>The problem with my blog is the colour contrast. My background is a basketball hoop and the net on the hoop is white, but so is my headings,text, and tables so I need to either change the background or the colour of the headings and text. Also my borders a bit plain and i will change the style to make it more professional. </td>

    <td>To improve my learning i will do what i did today which is learn from my mistakes and the feedback and criticism i'm given, I should use it as its ways my teacher thinks I can get better or in this case have a better and more professional blog.</td>
