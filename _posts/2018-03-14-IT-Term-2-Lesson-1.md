**IT Term 2 Lesson 1**

This was are first lesson back of doing IT after finishing drama. This term we are carrying on with coding and using coding programs. First we started by telling him how to draw a shape for example a circle or square. However he acted like a Robot and how a robot would react to those commands. 

So if we told him to draw left the up he might not draw in a straight line and a different length to the other sides. Doing this exercise got us thinking about coding and how precise you have to be.

Then we started using coding with a turtle on the page. We gave it commands to move and make a Square, rectangle then pentagon. We did this by telling it the commands to move left and right by what angle . The turtle would leave a trace of its movement making the shape. Then we did the same for our initials and added colour.
