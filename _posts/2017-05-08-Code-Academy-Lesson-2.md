  <tr>
    <td>Strategies that were effective were going at it at my own pace.
Even though their was a lot of people who were further on than me it didn't bother me as the person sitting next to me was always on the same 1 as me or one ahead or behind. This meant if one of us was stuck it was likely that so was the other one on the same coding or maybe one ahead so they could help the other one and show them what to do. This picture is a badge showing i've done 25 exercises. When we get  one of these which will probably be every lesson we have to screenshot and post it on here.
                                                                   </td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What I need to work on is being precise with my coding. Sometimes i would do the code it wants me to word for word but it was not an acceptable code and I had to do it again. This was because of something as small s 1 capital letter or 1 space. So I need to make sure i look at the coding properly  and not make simple mistakes.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will try and be more careful. I will look out for things like capital letters and spaces and if they're needed I will add them in. The reason I think I didn't see them and missed them out was because I wasn't focusing enough and was rushing my coding. So next time I will be extra careful and not rush as it doesn't matter how fast i'm going as long as I learn from what i'm doing.</td>
