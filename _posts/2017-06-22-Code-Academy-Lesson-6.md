    <td>The way I learnt was getting things wrong. I was stuck on this coding for ages and was really struggling. I got onto it last week with 10 minutes of the  lesson left and still didn't finish it. The coding was a summary of everything I had learnt that topic. We are using python. To complete python you have to go through loads of small coding topics. Each have about 12 codes/steps you have to do, and when you finish it you have to do it all in one big coded which was the thing I was struggling with however I persevered and finally finished it today as well as starting a new topic</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my working was at the start I was in someone else's account. As soon as you go onto codecademy it will ask you to sign in. However if someone forgot to sign out it goes straight onto their account  and where they were last at. This happend to me as the last person who used codecademy on the same computer did not sign out. But I didn't realise and carried on on their account. I only realised when I was further ahead than anyone but in the last lesson people were way ahead of me.</td>

    <td>Next time I will try and make sure i'm on the right account as I wasted my own time by doing his work not mine. Also I will try and remember to sign out like I have been doing so the same doesn't happen to the person who uses codecademy after me.</td>
