    <td>Today I made sure that I read through the descriptions and instructions precisely to make sure that I didn't make any stupid mistakes in my coding. This technique worked surprisingly well as beforehand I used to not read them properly and therefore make what would otherwise be obvious mistakes.

In github I have just coded in the read more sign however it is in the wrong place.
